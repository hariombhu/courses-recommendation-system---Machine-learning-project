Course Recommendation System

This project implements a **Machine Learning-based Course Recommendation System** to suggest personalized courses. It uses course similarity, user profiles, and clustering techniques to generate recommendations.

Features
- Personalized Recommendations: Suggests courses based on user preferences and interactions.
- Clustering: Groups users with similar profiles for targeted suggestions.
- User-Course Matching: Matches user vectors with course profiles for tailored results.

How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing: Loads and processes user profiles, courses, and ratings data.
2. Model Training: Uses K-Means clustering to group users and refines predictions.
3. Prediction: Scores courses for users based on similarity thresholds or cluster membership.

 Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`

Usage
1. Prepare data files: `ratings.csv`, `course_processed.csv`, `user_profile.csv`.
2. Train models or predict courses using provided functions.
3. View results with course IDs and recommendation scores.
